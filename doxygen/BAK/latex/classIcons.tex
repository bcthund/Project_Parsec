\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Special form of button using an image atlas source. 

\DoxyHorRuler


Acts just like a button, even has a duplicate of a buttons code with the addition of drawing an icon. It does not inherit from a button because that would bring some extra settings not used in icons (text).

Padding defines how the icon is drawn inside the given dimensions. Therefore padding cannot be used to determine field position.
